# Rust good first issues project

Why this project? To have fun and learn Rust!!

The idea is to build a website where everyone can find Github repositories build with Rust. The list of repositories will be ordered by the ones with more issues with the tag "help-wanted". Users also will be able to see the details of each repository and all the issues with the label "good-first-issue". 

The main goal of this project is to build a place where Rust beginners can use it as a source to do their first contribution to the Rust ecosystem.

Wish me luck!
